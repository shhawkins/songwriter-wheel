# Opus Ideas: Making Chord Wheel Writer Extraordinary

Creative vision for transforming this app into a must-have tool that musicians would actually pay for.

---

## The Core Insight

The chord wheel is **the Rosetta Stone of music theory**. It's a single visual that unlocks harmony for anyone willing to study it. But physical wheels are static. A digital version can be **alive** — it can teach, respond, suggest, and create alongside you.

The opportunity isn't just digitizing a tool. It's **democratizing music theory education** while giving professionals a workflow accelerator they can't live without.

## Tier 1: The Foundation (Free)

Give away the basics to build the user base:

- Interactive chord wheel with all 12 keys
- Basic timeline for chord progression building
- Chord playback with piano sounds
- PDF export for chord sheets
- Key signature display and diatonic highlighting

This alone beats any static image or physical wheel. It's the hook.

## Tier 2: Premium Features ($9/month or $79/year)

### 1. **AI Chord Progression Generator**

> "Give me a melancholic verse that builds tension, then release into a hopeful chorus"

The AI generates progressions based on:
- **Emotional descriptors**: sad, triumphant, mysterious, dreamy, aggressive
- **Genre templates**: jazz standards, pop hits, gospel, EDM builds
- **Reference songs**: "Something like the verse in 'Creep' by Radiohead"

**Why it's valuable**: Songwriters get unstuck instantly. They learn by seeing what the AI suggests and understanding why those chords create that feeling.

### 2. **Interactive Theory Lessons**

Built-in curriculum that teaches through doing:

**Module 1: The Basics**
- What is a chord?
- Major vs. minor — hear and feel the difference
- Building triads from scales

**Module 2: The Circle of Fifths**
- Why this shape matters
- Key relationships visualized
- Modulation paths

**Module 3: Chord Functions**
- Tonic, Subdominant, Dominant
- Why I-IV-V-I feels complete
- The magic of the ii-V-I

**Module 4: Beyond Diatonic**
- Secondary dominants (V/V, V/vi)
- Modal interchange
- Borrowed chords

**Module 5: Advanced Concepts**
- Tritone substitution
- Negative harmony
- Coltrane changes

Each lesson is **interactive** — users apply concepts on the wheel immediately. Quizzes that require building progressions, not just answering multiple choice.

### 3. **Smart Analysis Mode**

Paste in a chord progression (or import MIDI) and the app:
- Identifies the key(s)
- Labels every chord with roman numerals

## The Killer Differentiator: Contextual Learning

Every feature teaches. When the AI suggests a chord, it explains:

> "I suggested Bb major here (borrowed IV from C minor) because you wanted a 'bittersweet' feeling. This is called modal interchange — borrowing from the parallel minor key. It's the same trick Radiohead uses in the chorus of 'Creep' when they go from G to B, which is the same idea but borrowing from G minor."

This turns every interaction into a learning moment. Users don't just get chord progressions — they understand **why** those chords work.

## Why This Can Win

### Moat 1: The Visualization

The chord wheel is **ancient wisdom** in a perfect visual form. Most music theory apps show scales linearly or use sheet music notation. The wheel is intuitive, memorable, and unique.

### Moat 2: The Curriculum

A structured learning path from "what is a chord?" to "Coltrane changes" doesn't exist in an interactive format. YouTube has pieces. Books have theory. Nothing has hands-on practice with instant feedback.

### Moat 3: The AI Integration

ChatGPT can explain music theory but can't show it. MIDI generators make progressions but can't explain them. We do both, together, in context.

### Moat 4: The Tool-to-Learning Pipeline

Free tool → Gets people making music → They hit walls → Learning content explains concepts → They level up → They pay to unlock advanced features

This is the Duolingo model for music theory.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Nail the core experience** — The free tier has to be *chef's kiss*
2. **Build the AI progression generator** — This is the wow moment
3. **Create 5 foundational theory lessons** — Prove the curriculum works
4. **Launch beta to music subreddits** — r/musictheory, r/songwriting, r/WeAreTheMusicMakers
5. **Gather feedback on what premium features matter most**
6. **Build the subscription system** — Stripe integration

## The Vision Statement

> **Chord Wheel Writer: Where every musician becomes a songwriter, and every songwriter becomes a better musician.**

We're not building a tool. We're building a music education revolution disguised as a songwriting app.

*"The best time to learn music theory was 20 years ago. The second best time is right now, on this app."*
