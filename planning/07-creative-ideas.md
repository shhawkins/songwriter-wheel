# Songwriter's Wheel - Creative Ideas & Enhancements

## Original Feature Ideas

These are creative additions that go beyond the basic Chord Wheel concept to make Songwriter's Wheel truly unique and valuable.

---

## 🎨 Visual & Interactive Enhancements

### 1. **"Harmonic Gravity" Visualization**
Show visual arrows/lines between chords indicating their harmonic pull:
- Thick glowing arrow from V → I (strongest pull)
- Medium arrows for common progressions (ii → V, vi → IV)
- Animate arrows pulsing when those chords are in your timeline

### 2. **Chord Color Mixing**
When hovering over a chord slot in the timeline, blend the colors of adjacent chords to show harmonic "smoothness":
- Similar colors = smooth transition
- Contrasting colors = dramatic change
- Visual gradient connecting the progression

### 3. **"Tension & Release" Meter**
Display a real-time graph above the timeline showing:
- Low = stable/resolved (I, vi)
- Medium = movement (ii, IV)
- High = tension (V, vii°)
- Creates a visual "emotional arc" of your song

### 4. **3D Wheel Option**
Toggle to view the wheel as a 3D cylinder:
- Major chords on top
- Minor chords in the middle
- Diminished at bottom
- Rotate by dragging in 3D space

### 5. **Constellation Mode**
Alternative visualization where chords are stars:
- Brighter stars = more commonly used chords
- Lines connect related chords
- Your progression creates a "path through the stars"

## 🎹 Audio Enhancements

### 6. **Voice Leading Preview**
When adding a chord, show and play how the individual notes move:
- Display smooth voice leading between chords
- Highlight common tones that stay
- Show notes that move by step vs. leap

### 7. **Strumming Patterns**
For guitar users, add selectable strum patterns:
- Down-Down-Up-Down-Up
- Fingerpicking arpeggios
- Different patterns per section
- Visual strum indicator during playback

### 8. **Genre-Specific Sounds**
Audio presets that change voicings and rhythm:
- **Jazz**: Extended voicings (9ths, 13ths), swing rhythm
- **Pop**: Simple triads, straight rhythm
- **R&B**: 7th chords, neo-soul voicings
- **Rock**: Power chords, driving beat
- **Classical**: Proper voice leading, arpeggiated

### 9. **Chord Drone Mode**
Hold down current chord as a sustained pad while exploring other chords:
- Great for finding what "works" over a bass note
- Useful for modal exploration
- Toggle between root drone and full chord drone

### 10. **"What If" Preview**
Hover over a chord before adding to hear it in context:
- Plays previous chord → hovered chord → next chord

## 📚 Educational Features

### 14. **Interactive Theory Lessons**
Guided tutorials that use your own progression:
- "Let's add a secondary dominant to your chorus"
- "Here's how to modulate your bridge to the relative minor"
- Lessons adapt to what you've written

### 15. **Ear Training Integration**
Mini-games within the app:
