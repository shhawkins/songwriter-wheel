## The Circle of Fifths

The Circle of Fifths is the foundation of the Chord Wheel. Moving clockwise, each key is a perfect fifth (7 semitones) higher than the previous.

```
        C
    F       G
  Bb          D
    Eb      A
      Ab  E
        B/Cb
      Gb/F#  Db/C#
```

### Key Signature Pattern
- **Sharps** (clockwise from C): G(1♯), D(2♯), A(3♯), E(4♯), B(5♯), F♯(6♯)
- **Flats** (counter-clockwise from C): F(1♭), B♭(2♭), E♭(3♭), A♭(4♭), D♭(5♭), G♭(6♭)

### Order of Sharps: F C G D A E B
### Order of Flats: B E A D G C F (reverse)

## Diatonic Chords

For any major key, the 7 diatonic chords are built on each scale degree:

| Degree | Roman | Quality | Function | Example (Key of C) |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I | Major | Tonic | C |
| 2 | ii | Minor | Subdominant | Dm |
| 3 | iii | Minor | Tonic/Mediant | Em |
| 4 | IV | Major | Subdominant | F |
| 5 | V | Major | Dominant | G |
| 6 | vi | Minor | Tonic/Submediant | Am |
| 7 | vii° | Diminished | Dominant | B° |

## Modes

Each mode is derived from starting on a different scale degree of the major scale:

| Mode | Degree | Pattern | Character | Example in C |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Ionian | I | W-W-H-W-W-W-H | Major, happy | C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C |

W = Whole step, H = Half step

## Common Progressions

### Pop/Rock
- **I - V - vi - IV** (C - G - Am - F) "Axis of Awesome"
- **I - IV - V - I** (C - F - G - C) Classic rock
- **vi - IV - I - V** (Am - F - C - G) "Despacito" progression
- **I - vi - IV - V** (C - Am - F - G) 50s doo-wop

### Jazz
- **ii - V - I** (Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7) Most common jazz cadence
- **I - vi - ii - V** (Cmaj7 - Am7 - Dm7 - G7) Rhythm changes
- **iii - vi - ii - V** (Em7 - Am7 - Dm7 - G7) Extended turnaround

### Blues
- **12-Bar Blues**: I(4) - IV(2) - I(2) - V(1) - IV(1) - I(2)

### Sad/Emotional
- **i - VI - III - VII** (Am - F - C - G) Aeolian progression
- **i - iv - v - i** (Am - Dm - Em - Am) Minor key classic

## Chord Functions

### Tonic Function (Home)
- **I** - Primary tonic
- **vi** - Tonic substitute (relative minor)
- **iii** - Weak tonic substitute

### Subdominant Function (Movement away)
- **IV** - Primary subdominant
- **ii** - Subdominant substitute

### Dominant Function (Tension, wants to resolve to tonic)
- **V** - Primary dominant
- **vii°** - Dominant substitute (shares 3 notes with V7)

## Harmonic Concepts

### Relative Major/Minor
Every major key has a relative minor that shares the same key signature:
- C major ↔ A minor
- G major ↔ E minor
- D major ↔ B minor
- etc.

The relative minor is built on the 6th degree (vi) of the major scale.

### Parallel Major/Minor
Same root, different quality:
- C major ↔ C minor
- G major ↔ G minor

Used for modal interchange (borrowing chords).

### Secondary Dominants
A dominant 7th chord that resolves to a chord other than I:
- **V/V** (D7 in key of C) → resolves to G
- **V/ii** (A7 in key of C) → resolves to Dm
- **V/vi** (E7 in key of C) → resolves to Am

### Tritone Substitution
Replace a dominant chord with the dominant chord a tritone (6 semitones) away:
- G7 → D♭7 (both share the same tritone: B and F)

### Borrowed Chords (Modal Interchange)
Chords borrowed from parallel minor:
- **♭VII** (B♭ in key of C) from C minor
- **iv** (Fm in key of C) from C minor
- **♭VI** (A♭ in key of C) from C minor

---

## Voice Leading Principles

1. **Common Tones**: Keep notes that appear in both chords
2. **Stepwise Motion**: Move other voices by step when possible
3. **Contrary Motion**: Voices move in opposite directions
4. **Avoid Parallel 5ths/Octaves**: Classical voice leading rule

## Cadences

| Name | Progression | Character |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Perfect Authentic | V → I | Strong resolution |
| Plagal | IV → I | "Amen" cadence |
| Half | any → V | Unfinished, tension |
| Deceptive | V → vi | Surprise, bittersweet |

## Songwriting Prompts (For Gamification)

### Beginner
- Write a 4-chord progression using only I, IV, V, and vi
- Create a verse using ii - V - I
- Write a progression in a minor key

### Intermediate
- Use a secondary dominant (V/V) in your chorus
- Write a bridge that modulates to the relative minor
- Create a progression using a borrowed chord

### Advanced
- Write a progression using tritone substitution
- Create a section in Dorian mode
- Use a deceptive cadence to extend your song

## Educational Tooltips (For App)

### Chord Wheel Hover Text

**On I chord**: "The I chord (tonic) is home base. Most songs begin and end here. It provides resolution and stability."

**On ii chord**: "The ii chord is a minor chord with subdominant function. It often leads to V (ii-V-I is the most common jazz progression)."

**On iii chord**: "The iii chord is the 'mysterious' diatonic chord. It can act as a tonic substitute or lead to vi."

**On IV chord**: "The IV chord (subdominant) creates movement away from home. The plagal cadence (IV-I) is the 'Amen' sound."

**On V chord**: "The V chord (dominant) creates the strongest pull back to I. As V7, it's even more powerful."

**On vi chord**: "The vi chord is the relative minor - it shares the same notes as the major key but sounds sad. Great for emotional contrast."

**On vii° chord**: "The vii° (diminished) chord is unstable and rarely used on its own. It shares three notes with V7 and wants to resolve to I."
