12/17 songwriter wheel tasks
- Audio issue. When I navigate to other pages / apps and come back, the audio doesn't work. I have to restart the app (for the add to homescreen version) by swiping up on iOS and swiping up again to stop the app. In web browser I often have to quit the browser or open a new private tab. 
- Preview favicon when sharing on Reddit / socials? (Low priority)
- Inversion controls squished in iPad chord panel; add second breakpoint
- new Tap and hold gesture
- Tap and hold on chord badge opens new in-key chord modal. This shows the current in-key chords in the same style as the chord badge button on a modal for easy access
- Random functionality to get started. Algorithmic chord progression generation with interesting results (difficult or no? Could be premium feature)
- E# dim not playing regardless of selected key. This is the only chord behaving this way
- Add Vercel analytics
- Tapping arrows in song section modal in song map view closes the modal and song map view. We see the main page. We should see the next or previous song section, just like we do when viewing song section modal in timeline view.  
- Show cycle controls in song map view and song section preview
- component to easily be able to record sample without editing directly from mobile microphone
- **Instrument control panel to explore tone.js possibilities; little tool/slider icon near the instrument voice dropdown; built-in tuner; autotrimming clips**
- Fix progressive web app layout
- Bug where audio engine stops requiring new incognito reload
- Add small ‘buy me a coffee’ button at footer of chord wheel guide modal
- Timeline preview component should be able to click to select section, but clicking selects the next section left/right
- Notepad AND lyrics by section
- clicking manage instruments in song map view should close the song map modal
- Favicon 20% smaller / a bit less pastel / maybe dark theme...
- inversion controls in suggested voicing modal. Toolbar icon near voice selection (use the same one we see in our song section icons on the main timeline. The purple one you tap to open)
- Clicking "i" in suggested voicing modal for out of key chords should do the follow: open both "Guitar & suggested voicing for key" AND "Voicing" section. For in key chords, the voicing section remains collapsed
- Add playable scale strip under each mode. This should play the notes for each mode which we've already calculated
- more conspicuous inversion controls (arrows are hard to see / people might not notice or understand these controls)
- Ability to play piano and chords at the same time. Needs to disable pinch to zoom on wheel when playing keyboard. Need to look at how we handle touch. Can only play the wheel when not playing keyboard
- Thin strip above keyboard with dropdown to select mode. This will give us all the mode options for that key. The strip plays the selected mode. Already all calculated in our Scales section of the chord details panel
- Keyboard with mode strip on top should be playable in song map view
- Ability to strum guitar
- Progressive Web App refactor: app should be beautiful on all devices. Improve favicon so iOS app looks better. Take advantage of iPhone footer space. Optimize for porting to app stores (iOS, Google play, etc.).
